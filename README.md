# Ryan's Portfolio
This repository contains all the code + instructions on how I built my personal portfolio on an Azure Static Web App.

## Description
This portfolio was originally created in Fall 2020 using PHP for an assignment in college. In Fall 2021 I decided that .NET development is what I wanted to do while taking a course in it. So I decided to revive my old portfolio website and do it in full "Azure" way. This repository has GitHub actions setup to test/verify the code that's committed, then if the test pass, the changes go live on the Azure App Service.
